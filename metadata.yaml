summary: '"La resclosa: Drama en tres actes" by Ignasi Iglesias is a play written
  in the early 20th century. The work unfolds in a mountainous setting and explores
  themes of love, societal expectations, and personal sacrifice. The central characters
  include Nuria, a young woman caught in the turmoil of her emotions, and David, who
  harbors deep feelings for her, complicating her engagement to another man, Adriá.  At
  the start of the play, we are introduced to David and Arcadi, who are painting in
  nature while discussing artistic matters and the emotional state of their friend
  Adriá, who is engaged to Nuria. As the dialogue progresses, hints about the tension
  surrounding Nuria''s impending marriage emerge, along with hints of deep affections
  that complicate relationships among the characters. Notably, David faces an internal
  struggle as he expresses a desire to rescue Nuria from a life of servitude and unfulfilled
  dreams, while she grapples with her feelings and the pressures of obligation. The
  opening sets the stage for a dramatic exploration of these intertwining lives against
  the backdrop of societal expectations. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
